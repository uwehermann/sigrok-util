This is a small script for compiling sigrok and its dependencies
on Mac OS X.


Status
------

Working.


Requirements
------------

 - All requirements of the individual sigrok subprojects.
 - Homebrew (http://brew.sh)
   - Currently the script assumes that Homebrew is used and hardcodes certain
     package versions and paths.
   - You probably need to "brew link --force" certain packages that may be
     available on your system (from Apple) but are required in newer versions
     built by Homebrew: libffi (maybe others).
     Without linking "libffi" for example, the check for pygobject3 will fail.
   - We currently hardcode the build to use Qt 5.5 (not the latest available
     version) in order to remain compatible with some older Mac OS X versions.


Building
--------

 $ ./sigrok-native-macosx

Per default it will install the compiled packages in:

 $HOME/sr_macosx

Please edit the script if you want to change any settings.
