This is a small script for bundling PulseView/sigrok-cli and its dependencies
for Linux systems as an AppImage.

AppImage is a bundle format for Linux applications that allows the user to 
download an application, make it executable, and run.
No need to install. No system libraries or system preferences are altered.

For more information on AppImage, please see:

 http://appimage.org


Status
------

Working AppImages (stable releases and nightly builds) are provided here:

 https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads


Requirements
------------

The script assumes you have built all of the sigrok subprojects and
installed them into $HOME/sr (e.g. via the sigrok-cross-linux script).

It also assumes you have built AppImageKit in $HOME. First, install all
build requirements of AppImageKit (see AppImageKit docs or its
install-build-deps.sh file). Then:

 $ cd $HOME
 $ git clone https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit
 $ cd AppImageKit

Apply chdir.patch (required to fix sigrok bug #1300), then build:

 $ patch -p1 < chdir.patch
 $ ./build.sh

Temporary workaround for an AppImageKit issue:

 $ mkdir -p build/lib/appimagekit
 $ cp build/out/mksquashfs build/lib/appimagekit

The AppImages are tested to build fine on Ubuntu 16.04 (32bit and 64bit).
These older distros are used for the build so that the generated AppImages
can run on as many different systems as possible.


Building
--------

For PulseView:

 $ ./sigrok-native-appimage

For sigrok-cli:

 $ ./sigrok-native-appimage sigrok-cli

Per default the script will put the AppImages in:

 ./out/*.AppImage

Please edit the script if you want to change any settings.
